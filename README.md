# Data-Mining-SMU-Spring-2016
I compiled these analytics reports under the guidance of Prof. Michael Hahsler during my Masters in Computer Science program in the Spring of 2016 at Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas.
This was my first attemp at analytics with real data, so I was very excited about it, but there is so much more, that I still have to achieve. Becasue it was my first attempt, I did make several mistakes.
